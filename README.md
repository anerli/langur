# Langur

Langur makes it simple to build consistent, observable, and portable LLM agents.

> ⚠️ Langur is early in development. Expect frequent breaking changes. Depending on how it's configured Langur may be able to access arbitrary files or run code - use at your own risk.

## Setup

Install:
```
pip install langur
```

Langur uses Anthropic by default, and it's recommended you use larger models for the best results. If you want though, you can [easily swap the LLM backend](#configuring-llm). Otherwise, setup your anthropic key `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before proceeding!

## Getting Started

Here's a simple task solved using a Langur agent:
```python
from langur import Langur
from langur.connectors import Workspace

agent = Langur("Grade quizzes")
agent.use(
    Workspace(path="./workspace")
)
agent.run()
```
This is an [example](examples/grader/grader.py) that automatically identifies quizzes in the provided filesystem, grades them, and puts them into an empty `grades.csv` file.

The agent will:
1. Plan out how to "Grade quizzes" based on what we told it to `.use()` (just `Workspace` in this case).
2. Execute those actions

### Signals

But maybe instead of executing the plan right way, we might want to observe it first. Instead of directly running `agent.run()`, we can pass a signal when running the agent:
```python
from langur import Signal

agent.run(until=Signal.PLAN_DONE)
```

### Visualization
To observe the agent's plan, we can look at the corresponding behavioral graph. This can be done like so:
```python
agent.save_graph_html("agent.html")
# ^ and then open the html with your browser.
# Or, in a Jupyter notebook:
agent.show()
```
For this simple example, the behavior graph might look something like:

![](static/grading_graph.png)

Each node represents an action the agent plans to execute. 

### Caching

Let's say we like this behavior, and want to be able to re-use it - both to have consistent behavior and so the LLM doesn't have to plan out the same task again.

To do this, we can save the entire agent behavior graph in whatever state it's in, and re-run it later!

To save the agent behavior:
```python
agent.save("agent_with_great_plan.json")
```
then later, wherever and whenever you want:
```python
agent = Langur.load("agent_with_great_plan.json")
```

You could then continue the agent's execution from this point, where it has the plan you like in its behavioral state, by just running `agent.run()` once loaded.

Since this agent representation is plain JSON, you can even send agents over the wire, store them in a database, or do whatever you like really! They are completely portable and can be run on any system with Python and Langur installed.

### Available Connectors

Actions / connectors are available in any of these ways:
- `langur.connectors` contains a few built-in connectors which will be optimized for Langur's architecture. This will grow significantly over time
- Using `langchain` tools / toolkits: You can pass these directly to agent.use(...) and Langur will adapt them.
- Build your own! See [Building Connectors](#building-connectors).

### Going Further

Currently there is no documentation, however you can check out more examples by checking out the [challenges](./challenges) - which are different tasks meant to evaluate Langur's abilities in various capacities. You can also ask any questions you have in the [Langur Discord](https://discord.gg/wSBSP56V7U).

If this plan/execute behavior just doesn't work for your agent use case, another key tenet of Langur's design is to have **modular behavior** - so you can customize it to fit your needs. Learn more in [Customizing Behavior](#customizing-behavior).

## Building Connectors

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to build a custom connector:

```python
from langur import Langur, Connector, action
from langur.connectors import Terminal

class Calculator(Connector):
    @action
    def add(self, x: int, y: int):
        '''Add two numbers'''
        return x + y

    @action
    def multiply(self, x: int, y: int):
        '''Multiply two numbers'''
        return x * y

agent = Langur("What is (1494242 + 12482489284) * 24?")
agent.use(
    Calculator(),
    Terminal().disable("input")
)
agent.run()

>>> [OUTPUT] 299615604624
```

If you're familiar with existing LLM paradigms, the connector actions are generally similar to the concept of tools. However, connectors provide a convenient way to (1) package related actions together and (2) provides extra capabilities that aren't possible with the usual tool interface.

For example, if we want an action that actually makes another LLM call, we would want to have context about what's actually going on. Here's an example, the built-in LLM connector which allows the agent to do natural language processing as an action:

```python
from langur.actions import ActionContext
from langur.connector import Connector, action
import langur.baml_client as baml

class LLM(Connector):
    @action
    async def think(self, ctx: ActionContext) -> str:
        '''Do purely cognitive processing'''
        return await baml.b.Think(
            context=ctx.ctx,
            description=ctx.purpose,
            baml_options={"client_registry": ctx.cg.get_client_registry()}
        )
```
> [BAML](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml) is being used here to handle the prompting backend

The parameter `ctx: ActionContext` is a special parameter that includes information relevant to the action being executed. The LLM is unaware of this parameter - it is automatically injected if found in the signature of an action function definition.
- `ctx.purpose` contains a short natural language description of the specific purpose of a particular action use.
- `ctx.ctx` is any prompting context normally used to construct inputs for an action, but you can hook into it and use it as well. Print it out to see a bit of what's going on under the hood!

## Customizing Behavior

To customize agent behavior, pass AgentBehavior to the behavior kwarg when creating your agent instead of just passing in instructions: 

```python
from langur import Langur
from langur.connectors import Terminal
from langur.behavior import *

agent = Langur(
    behavior=AgentBehavior(
        Assume(),
        Plan(Task("Say Hi"), Task("Make a Meow")),
        Execute()
    )
)
agent.use(Terminal().disable("input"))
agent.run()
agent.save_graph_html("meow.html")
```

This example plans for two different tasks instead of one, and also includes an additional behavior `Assume` which isn't included by default. The `Assume` behavior make several assumptions about any provided tasks before planning actually starts, for example "verbal_output_required: The output should be a verbal/textual representation of a cat's meow sound".

In the future, there will be much more interesting and nontrivial variations of behavior available to use.

If you want to define completely new behaviors, that's also possible within the Langur framework. Currently it may be a bit tricky, so if you're interested in learning more about that, please reach out to me on the [Langur Discord](https://discord.gg/wSBSP56V7U).


## Configuring LLM

Langur is usually tested and developed with Anthropic models (Claude Sonnet 3.5). Therefore it is recommended you use the default Anthropic LLM configuration. However, you can customize the LLM used by the agent by passing an LLMConfig to your agent:
```python
from langur.llm import LLMConfig

agent = Langur(
    "Say hi",
    llm_config=LLMConfig(
        provider="openai",
        options={"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0}
    )
)
```
In this example, we configured Langur to use OpenAI's `gpt-4o` (which also tends to work fairly well). You can use open source LLMs by using Ollama / vLLM providers for example. Langur uses BAML for its prompting/LLM backend, so see https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-basics/switching-llms for more info on how to set up this configuration.

## Running Challenges
If you clone the repo, you can run the included challenges like so:
```sh
python ./challenges/challenge_runner.py <challenge_dir>
# For example:
python ./challenges/challenge_runner.py grader
```
These challenges are designed to test the abilities of the Langur system in various ways - many more will be added over time. If you have ideas for a challenge or use case you want to try, let me know!


## How it Works
Langur's behavior is driven entirely by various "metacognitive workers" operating on a shared "cognition graph". These workers might manipulate the graph itself, or they might be interacting with the real-world and relaying that information to the graph. Workers that interact with the real-world are also called [Connectors](#building-connectors), and Langur is designed to make these [Connectors](#building-connectors) easy to implement to define new modes of interaction with the world.

Why this approach?
1. Modular behavior - Agent behavior is driven by several workers instead of a centralized system. This makes it easier to add new behavior without accidentally affecting all other facets of behavior, and makes it possible for advanced users to design and include their own custom behavior.
2. Observability - Being able to see a graph representing the agent's behavior is incredibly useful for visually understanding the agent's intent, and promotes sanity as a developer designing systems that operate on the graph.
3. Parallelizability - Workers can potentially run in parallel (or concurrently really) - and since many of these workers are using LLMs to operate on the graph, we can speed up these I/O bound prompts.
4. Serializability - Since all behavior state is stored in the graph, we can save and load the graph in order to save and load agent behavior.
